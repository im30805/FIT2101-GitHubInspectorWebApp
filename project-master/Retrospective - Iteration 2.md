# project

This week we week managed to finish almost all of our sprint items. Danesh had 1 item left to finish.
We completed 28/33 points from the sprint.

Improvements from last sprint:
We believe we managed to complete a greater workload, even though we said we would have reduced it from last week. This is mainly due to all of us getting more familiar with the programming language and the available libraries or APIs.

Things to improve upon:
For this sprint, I believe we could organise more meetings, or structure them better. Sometimes, some members of the team cannot attend the meeting due to conflicting time slots. To resolve this, we could meet more frequently (twice a week), or organise a better time for everyone.
Our team could utilise the gitlab issue tracker when we get stuck. This will help when we run into issues, as the rest of team can assist.
Our team could communicate more using messenger more frequently. So far, responses are usually once a day per member. If the team could check the messages more frequently, it could assist in solving issues and organising meetings.
